i hope i don't run out of time. could someone call a tutor?

'cause i just need one more shot at my grades... 



i know you know that i made those mistakes maybe once or twice

and by once or twice i mean maybe a couple of hundred times

so let me, oh, let me do it, oh, do it, oh, tomorrow night

'cause i just need one more shot, on my grades...



yeah

is it too late now to say sorry?

i'll take every single piece of the paper if you want me to

but you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two

i'll go, i'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth

can we both say the words and forget this?
